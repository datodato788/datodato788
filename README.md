I build systems to understand how they fail — and how to secure them.

## CORE PROFILE

Engineering mindset over trends.  
Systems first. Details matter.

I’m Dato — focused on how real systems behave outside tutorials and demos.  
My work lives where web technologies, networks, and security intersect.

I study fundamentals deeply, stress them, break them, analyze the failure,  
then rebuild them cleanly and intentionally.

## PRACTICAL WORKFLOW

I design full-stack applications with clear data flow and predictable behavior.  
I analyze browser APIs such as camera, location, and metadata from a security and privacy perspective.  
I observe network behavior under real conditions, not simulations.  
I build proof-of-concept tools for understanding, not showing off.

I care more about how something works than how fast it is built.
